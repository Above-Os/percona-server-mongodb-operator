Requirements and limitations
-------------------------------------------

The operator was developed and/or tested for the following configurations only:

1. Percona Server for MongoDB 3.6

2. OpenShift 3.11

Other options may or may not work.

Also, current PSMDB on Kubernetes implementation does not support Percona Server for MongoDB sharding.
