*Percona Distribution for MongoDB Operator* 1.11.0
================================================================================

:Date: December 20, 2021
:Installation: For installation please refer to `the documentation page <https://www.percona.com/doc/kubernetes-operator-for-psmongodb/index.html#installation>`_

Release Highlights
================================================================================

* In addition to S3-compatible storage, you can now configure backups :ref:`to use Microsoft Azure Blob storage<backups.scheduled-azure>`. This feature makes the Operator fully compatible with Azure Cloud.
* :ref:`Custom sidecar containers<operator-sidecar>` allow users to customize Percona XtraDB Cluster and other Operator components without changing the container images. In this release, we enable even more customization, by allowing users to mount volumes into the sidecar containers.

New Features
================================================================================

* :jirabug:`K8SPSMDB-513`: Add support of Microsoft Azure Blob storage for backups

Improvements
================================================================================

* :jirabug:`K8SPSMDB-422`: It is now possible to set annotations to backup cron jobs (Thanks to Aliaksandr Karavai for contribution)
* :jirabug:`K8SPSMDB-534`: mongos readiness probe now avoids running listDatabases command for all databases in the cluster to avoid unneeded delays on clusters with an extremely large amount of databases
* :jirabug:`K8SPSMDB-527`: Timeout parameters for liveness and readiness probes can be customized to avoid false-positives for heavy-loaded clusters
* :jirabug:`K8SPSMDB-520`: Mount volumes into sidecar containers to enable customization

================================================================================

The following platforms were tested and are officially supported by the Operator 1.11.0:
